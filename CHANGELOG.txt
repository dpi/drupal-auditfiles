Accounted for reports with zero records, so they do not display errors.
Completed the "Used not referenced" report.

31 December 2014 (oadaeh)
----------------
Added a record limiter to all reports, so that reports that retrieve a large
amount of data can be made quicker.

for file references.

----------------
Created two new reports: "Managed but not used" and "Used but not managed."
Pulled the HTML tags out of the various descriptive texts in hook_help() (except
for the References and Unreferenced reports, as they still need re-factoring).
Changed the IDs for the permissions.
Updated README.txt with the two new reports and new structure (more needs to be
done, especially with updating content).
Updated INSTALL.txt to actually contain some useful information.

    removed from the new Drupal 6 menu system.

paths or extensions
