   - Access Audit Files' reports

     Users with this permission are allowed access to the various file audit
     reports.

     Users with this permission are allowed to access and change the system
     configuration settings (described below) for this module.

 * Configure the module in Administration » Configuration and modules » System »

   - Exclusions

     There may be some files, file extensions and/or directories used by Audit
     Files that you do not want to taken into consideration when generating the
     various reports. There are three fields that allow the site administrator
     the ability to exclude those items. In each field, enter in the list of
     respective items to exclude. Separate each exclusion with a space.

   - Domains

     Here you may enter a list of domains that will be considered local to the
     site in the reports for the purposes of creating links.

   - Report options

     These are various configuration options for how to format certain items in
     the reports. Currently, the available configurable options are the number
     of items to display per page and the date format to use.
